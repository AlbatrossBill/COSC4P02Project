"Field trips form an integral component of training in the earth sciences and are offered in all years of study, linked to specific courses. Field trips may take place during the lab period or involve a time period beyond the lab, over a single day or weekend trips. To offset transportation costs the Department has instituted a Field Trip Levy for all courses with multiple field trips. In addition, on single day or weekend trips, students are expected to cover costs of accommodation and food. Field trip costs, where applicable, are in addition to the regular tuition fees associated with the course.","Students admitted to the Co-op program must follow an approved program pattern.
