"This program provides background in theories and methodologies relevant to the learning and teaching of English as a second language. Teaching English to non-English speakers is a complex process that requires an appropriate background in the theories and methodologies of language teaching and learning and a period of supervised teaching. For example, students have opportunities to learn about first- and second-language acquisition, the structure of English, language testing and methodologies for teaching specific language skills. Practice teaching is an essential feature of this program.","Students who graduate from the Speech Language and Hearing Sciences program with a Concentration in Hearing Sciences are not yet qualified to evaluate or treat individuals with hearing or vestibular disorders, nor are they qualified in any capacity for work in supervised or unsupervised provision of clinical services."
