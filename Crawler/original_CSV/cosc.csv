Amber Cecchini,"In order to prepare students for professional practice, students in the BSc (Honours), BSc Co-op, and BSc with Major programs are highly recommended to complete courses in a focused discipline outside of computer science. It is widely recognized that the professional practice of computer science often requires domain knowledge-specialized knowledge of another discipline in which computing is applied. This phenomenon is often described as Computer Science + X."
